libsequence (1.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * PolySNP now returns "nan" for summary statistics that need an outgroup, but the outgroup is not present
  * Bug fix: when a PolySNP/PolySIM object was constructed from a SimData object that has 0 segregating sites, the value of 0 was returned for number of haplotypes.  It now correctly returns 1.

libsequence (1.5.9-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Binary compatibility broken with previous releases
  * Member functions of Sequence::SimData are now declared as virtual so that this class can be used as a base for reading in data from other infinitely-many sites coalescent simulation programs.  The main rationale for this is compatibility with Sequence::PolySIM to analyze these sorts of data
  * Schemes for throwing mutations down on ancestral recombination graphs are now more efficient
 -- Kevin Thornton <kt234@cornell.edu>  Fri, 29 Jul 2005 09:38:00 -0600
libsequence (1.5.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium
   * Undid the change to crossover routines for coalescent simulations that appeared in 1.5.7.  Turns out it caused massive memory consumption.
   * fixed this file so that debbuild works
 -- Kevin Thornton <kt234@cornell.edu>  Fri, 29 Jul 2005 09:38:00 -0600
libsequence (1.5.7-1) unstable; urgency=low
   * More efficient crossover routine in coalescent simulation
   * Bug in Sequence::SimpleSNP fixed (error was in call to RemoveInvariantColumns in member function read)
 -- Kevin Thornton <kt234@cornell.edu>  Mon, 29 Nov 2004 20:58:00 -0600
libsequence (1.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low
   * Definition of Sequence::Alignment::RemoveFixedOutgroupInsertions is no longer recursive

 -- Kevin Thornton <kt234@cornell.edu>  Mon, 29 Nov 2004 20:58:00 -0600
libsequence (1.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium
   * fixed bug in preprocessing of data in class Sequence::PolySNP.  The preprocessing itself was fine (i.e. no calculations were incorrect).  The problem was that not all functions ensured that preprocessing had occurred.  This meant that, if you did calculations in a certain order, you would get nonsense results for some statistics (i.e. Rm).  Now, preprocessing is done automaticall upon object construction
   * Definitions of Minrec are now non-recursive and moved into PolySNP.cc/PolySIM.cc from src/Recombination.cc
   * changed type of Sequence::marginal::nsam from const to mutable, to allow default copy operation
 -- Kevin Thornton <kt234@cornell.edu>  Mon, 29 Nov 2004 20:58:00 -0600

   * minor bugfixes in calculation of HKA statistics
 -- Kevin Thornton <kt234@cornell.edu>  Wed, 15 Sep 2004 16:42:00 -0600
libsequence (1.4.4-1) unstable; urgency=low
   * added #include <cctype> to source files using toupper, which didn't already include it.  The lack of including this file caused compilation to fail on some system (shouldn't it have done so on all systems?)
 -- Kevin Thornton <kt234@cornell.edu>  Thu, 8 Jul 2004 08:31:00 -0600
libsequence (1.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium
   * bugfixes : in PolySNP.cc, NumSingletons and NumExternalMutations could give incorrect results with missing data (in cases were all but 1 individual is missing).  This affected the output of Fu & Li statistics.  
   * class SimData now does output exactly like hudson's ms program when there are 0 segregating sites
   * class SimData can now be read in from C-style FILE *.
   * made implementations of routines for coalescent simulation a little more robust to uniform random number generators that return 1.0

   *added several new headers providing template functions for simple statistics
   *fixed some bugs in Sequence::SimpleSNP (sample size now printed correctly upon output when there is an outgroup)
   *fixed bug in Recombination::Disequilibrium (frequency filter now works, case-insensitivity implemented).  And, for D and D', the 11 gamete type is in terms of the minor (or derived) allele
   *fixed use of assert() to deal with compiler warnings
 -- Kevin Thornton <kt234@cornell.edu>  Mon, 12 May 2004 15:02:00 -0600
libsequence (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=high
   * PolySNP -- member functions explicitly check for gaps in snps
   * PolySNP -- NumExternalMutations() was incorrect, leading to bad values for Fu/Li statistics with outgroup.  Fixed.

   * SimpleSNP -- fixed segfault on input for files containing outgroup data
   * PolyTableFunctions.hpp added, contains functions to manipulate PolyTable objects in non-const ways

   * fixed bug in Sequence::PolyTable::Binary() that caused the transformed data not to be assigned

   * non-const operator[] added to PolyTable
   * public memeber assign() added to AlignStream
   * print() defined for Clustalw
   * removed Hudson's code (since in practice everyone just pipes the results of ms to another program anyways...)
