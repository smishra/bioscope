            &quot;And how does a monk remain focused on the body in &amp; of itself?<br>
            [1] &quot;There is the case where a monk -- having gone to the wilderness, 
            to the shade of a tree, <br>
            or to an empty building -- sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding 
            his body erect and <br>
            setting mindfulness to the fore [lit: the front of the chest]. Always 
            mindful, he breathes in; <br>
            mindful he breathes out.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;Breathing in long, he discerns that he is breathing 
            in long; or breathing out long, he discerns that he is breathing out 
            long. Or breathing in short, he discerns that he is breathing in short; 
            or breathing out short, he discerns that he is breathing out short. 
            He trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the entire body and to 
            breathe out sensitive to the entire body. He trains himself to breathe 
            in calming bodily fabrication and to breathe out calming bodily fabrication. 
            Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long <br>
            turn, discerns that he is making a long turn, or when making a short 
            turn discerns that he is making a short turn; in the same way the 
            monk, when breathing in long, discerns that he is breathing in long; 
            or breathing out short, he discerns that he is breathing out short... 
            He trains himself to breathe in calming bodily fabrication, and to 
            breathe out calming bodily <br>
            fabrication.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on 
            the body in &amp; of itself, or externally on the body in &amp; of 
            itself, or both internally &amp; externally on the body in &amp; of 
            itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with 
            regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard 
            to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination &amp; passing away 
            with regard to the body. Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body' 
            is maintained to the extent of knowledge &amp; remembrance. And he 
            remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging <br>
            to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the 
            body in &amp; of itself.<br>
            <br>
            .</font><font size="-1">[2] &quot;Furthermore, when walking, the monk 
            discerns that he is walking. When standing, he discerns that he is 
            standing. When sitting, he discerns that he is sitting. When lying 
            down, he discerns that he is lying down. Or however his body is disposed, 
            that is how he discerns it.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">[3] &quot;Furthermore, when going forward &amp; returning, 
            he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward &amp; looking away...when 
            bending &amp; extending his limbs...when carrying his outer cloak, 
            his upper robe &amp; his bowl...when eating, drinking, chewing, &amp; 
            savoring...when urinating &amp; defecating...when walking, standing, 
            sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, &amp; remaining silent, 
            he makes himself fully alert.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">&quot;In this way he remains focused internally on 
            the body in &amp; of itself, or focused xternally...unsustained by 
            anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body 
            in &amp; of itself.</font></p>
          <p><font size="-1">[4] &quot;Furthermore...just as if a sack with openings 
            at both ends were full of various kinds of grain --wheat, rice, mung 
            beans, kidney beans, sesame seeds, husked rice -- and a man with good 
            eyesight, pouring it out, were to reflect, 'This is wheat. This is 
            rice. These are mung beans. These are kidney beans. These are sesame 
            seeds. This is husked rice,' in<br>
            the same way, monks, a monk reflects on this very body from the soles 
            of the feet on up, from the crown of the head on down, surrounded 
            by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things: 'In this body 
            there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, 
            bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, 
            large intestines, small <br>
            intestines, gorge, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, 
            skin-oil, saliva, mucus, fluid in the joints, urine.'<br>
            <br>
            &quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp; 
            of itself, or focused externally ..unsustained by anything in the 
            world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of

            that he is feeling a painful feeling. When feeling a pleasant feeling, 
            he discerns that he is feeling a pleasant feeling. When feeling a

            &quot;And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in &amp;

            [1] &quot;There is the case where a monk remains focused on mental 
            qualities in &amp; of themselves with reference to the five hindrances. 
            And how does a monk remain focused on mental qualities in &amp; of 
            themselves with reference to the five hindrances? There is the case 
            where, there <br>
            being sensual desire present within, a monk discerns that 'There is 
            sensual desire present within me.' Or, there being no sensual desire 
            present within, he discerns that 'There is no sensual desire present 
            within me.' He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual 
            desire. And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire 
            once it has arisen. <br>
            And he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of 
            sensual desire that has been abandoned. (The same formula is repeated 
            for the remaining hindrances: ill will, sloth &amp; drowsiness, restlessness 
            &amp; anxiety, and uncertainty.)</font></p>
